I helped co-found Friends of Papago Park to help raise awareness and funds for the defense of Papago Park in the greater Phoenix, AZ area. This revered and highly-trafficked urban reacreation area has been under threat from developers and illicit drug users for years. Our mission, and the mission of the website I built is to restore the park to a state of safety and natural serenity.
